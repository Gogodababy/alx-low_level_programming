Nested loops are also known as "loop inside loop" because they involve a loop statement inside another loop statement. In other words, a nested loop is a loop that is contained within the body of another loop. It is important to include the prototypes of all functions, including the prototype for the _putchar function, in the main.h header file. This file contains all the function prototypes used in the project and is essential to its successful execution. Additionally, there are several advanced tasks in the project, including functions that print the n times table, compute the sum of multiples of 3 or 5, and print the Fibonacci sequence.
